## Overview of LV Op-Amp IP
The low power operational amplifier consists of two stages and operates at 1.8V power. It is designed to meet a set of provided specification such as high gain and low power consumption.

This two-stage op-amp is designed using the Skywater 130nm technology library. The proposed two stage op-amp consists of NMOS current mirror as bias circuit, differential amplifier as the first stage and common source amplifier as the second stage. 

The first stage of an op-amp contributed high gain while the second stage contributes a moderate gain. The results show that the circuit is able to work at 1.8V power supply voltage (VDD)

# Open-Source-Tools-Used

- eSim 
    - eSim (previously known as Oscad / FreeEDA) is a free/libre and open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design. It is an integrated tool built using free/libre and open source software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. eSim is released under GPL.
    - https://esim.fossee.in/home

- Ngspice
    - ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits.
    - http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/

- SkyWater Open Source PDK
    - The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.

- Magic
    - Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies. The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication technology.
